# Mutate-Compute

Code execution is designed to be launched either from one of the Python launcher scripts in /MutateCompute/src/launchers, or from
 one of the bash scripts in /MutateCompute/bash/.
 
Locally:
From terminal, cd to wherever you have downloaded the MutateCompute codebase. On my computer it looks like this:
cd /Users/u0120577/PycharmProjects/MutateCompute/bash/  


to run from Pycharm IDE either locally or on the cluster, select Run from the toolbar:
Run|Edit Configurations|Python|KickOffPy and select Apply/Run. 
The script path should be: /Users/u0120577/PycharmProjects/MutateCompute/src/launchers/KickOff.py
The working directory: /Users/u0120577/PycharmProjects/MutateCompute/src
